{
  "design_assumptions": "The model assumes complete financial history is available for all applicants. It is designed to evaluate creditworthiness based on historical repayment behavior, income stability, and existing debt.",

  "compliance_tradeoffs": "We reduced model complexity to improve explainability, which slightly reduced accuracy but significantly improved transparency in decision-making as required by the EU AI Act.",

  "bias_mitigation": "We implemented post-processing techniques to minimize gender and age bias. Protected attributes are excluded from the model's training data, and we apply fairness constraints during prediction.",

  "oversight_assessment": "Human oversight is implemented through a mandatory approval workflow before any model deployment. The system flags potentially biased predictions for human review.",

  "continuous_compliance_plan": "The system continuously monitors fairness metrics and performance. Automated retraining is triggered if drift is detected, with a quarterly schedule for full compliance reassessment.",

  "cybersec_measures": "The model and data are secured using access controls, encryption at rest and in transit, regular security scanning, and vulnerability assessment of the deployment infrastructure.",

  "limitations": "The system may have lower accuracy for applicants with limited credit history. It should not be used as the sole determining factor for loan approvals.",

  "unintended_outcomes": "The system may inadvertently perpetuate historical biases present in the training data. There is also a risk of creating a feedback loop where individuals denied credit cannot build credit history.",

  "post_market_plan": "We monitor model performance daily with automated alerting for drift detection. User feedback is collected through a structured feedback API and quarterly audits are conducted to assess overall system impact."
