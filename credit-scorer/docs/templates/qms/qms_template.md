# Quality-Management System (QMS) Manual

_EU AI Act Article 8 & 17 ‚Äì Credit-Scoring AI_  
**Compliant with EU 2024/1689 & ISO 42001**

---

## 1 Quality Policy üìú

This manual defines how we satisfy Article 17‚Äôs requirement for a documented QMS for high-risk AI.  
It links written procedures to the **automated evidence** generated by our ZenML pipelines.

Our organization commits to building AI systems that are safe, fair, and transparent, in line with the EU AI Act (Regulation 2024/1689) and ISO 42001 standards. We follow a risk-based approach to ensure our high-risk AI systems meet all applicable requirements.

## 2 Scope üîç

This QMS applies to all high-risk AI systems as defined in the EU AI Act under Article 6/Annex III ¬ß 5(b), specifically the credit scoring system implemented in this repository that impacts financial opportunities for individuals.

## 4 Risk-Management Procedure ‚ö†Ô∏è

This section describes how you create and update risk entries for each run.

| Phase                       | Tool / File                                                                                     |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Initial classification      | Determine if system qualifies as high-risk under the EU AI Act                                  |
| Quantitative scoring        | Automated in `steps/risk_assessment.py` which writes to `compliance/risk_register.xlsx` per run |
| Hazard & mitigation mapping | Documented in risk register with links to specific mitigations in `src/constants.py`            |
| Approval threshold          | Risk score ‚â§ 0.4 OR explicit override by Compliance Officer                                     |

## 5 Development & Validation üß™ (Automated)

All technical controls are implemented inside ZenML pipelines:

| Compliance need        | ZenML step          | ZenML evidence                                |
| ---------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Data integrity & hash  | `ingest`            | logs metadata (`data_snapshot`)               |
| Pre-processing log     | `data_preprocessor` | logs metadata (`preprocessing_info`)          |
| Perf & fairness        | `evaluate_model`    | logs metadata (`metrics`, `fairness_summary`) |
| Risk register          | `risk_assessment`   | stores `risk_register.xlsx` + logs hazards    |
| Annex IV technical doc | `post_run_annex`    | auto-generates `reports/annex_iv_<run>.pdf`   |

| Annex IV PDF     | `reports/annex_iv_<run>.pdf`                | 10+ years |
| Risk register    | `compliance/risk_register.xlsx`             | 10+ years |
| Fairness reports | `compliance/fairness/*.json`                | 10+ years |
| Incident log     | `compliance/incident_log.json`              | 10+ years |
| Monitoring plans | `compliance/monitoring/{plan_id}.json`      | 10+ years |
| QMS docs         | `compliance/qms/` (Git-versioned)           | 10+ years |

_Incidents are categorized by severity:_

- **Critical**: Immediate attention required, potential for harm (üö®)
- **High**: Significant issue requiring prompt action (üî¥)
- **Medium**: Important but not immediately disruptive (‚ö†Ô∏è)
- **Low**: Minor issue for routine resolution
