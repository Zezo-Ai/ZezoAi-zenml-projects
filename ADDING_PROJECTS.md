# Adding Projects to ZenML Projects Repository

<!-- Note: This guide is primarily for ZenML internal development use -->

This guide explains how to add your ZenML project to this repository and make it available through the ZenML Projects platform.

## üìã Requirements

Every project added to this repository must include:

1. **requirements.txt file** - Contains all Python dependencies
2. **Dockerfile** (if special configuration is needed)
3. **Backend configuration** - YAML file in the zenml-projects-backend repository

## üê≥ Docker Configuration

### When to Include a Dockerfile

Include a custom Dockerfile **only if** your project requires:
- Special system dependencies
- Custom environment variables
- Additional configuration beyond Python packages
- Specific build steps

### Dockerfile Structure

If your project needs a custom Dockerfile, follow this exact structure:

```dockerfile
ARG ZENML_VERSION=latest
ARG PROJECT_DIR_NAME
ARG EXTENSION_VERSION=0.1.6

FROM zenmldocker/zenml-codespace:${ZENML_VERSION}

# Set build arguments again for use in subsequent commands
ARG PROJECT_DIR_NAME
ARG EXTENSION_VERSION

# Set the working directory for the project
WORKDIR /home/coder/extensions/zenml-io.zenml-tutorial-${EXTENSION_VERSION}-universal/pipelines

# Copy the specific project's requirements file
COPY ./${PROJECT_DIR_NAME}/requirements.txt /tmp/requirements.txt

# Install project-specific dependencies using uv for faster installation
RUN uv pip install --system --no-cache -r /tmp/requirements.txt && \
    rm /tmp/requirements.txt

# Enable tutorial content for this specific project
ENV ZENML_ENABLE_TUTORIAL=true

# Default command can be overridden in docker run or docker-compose
# CMD ["python", "run.py"] # Or your project's typical entrypoint
```

### When No Dockerfile is Needed

If your project only requires Python dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`, **do not include a Dockerfile**. The projects backend will automatically build your project using the generic Dockerfile available at the zenml-projects-backend repo.

## üîß Backend Integration

### YAML Configuration File

Once your project is added to this repository, you **must** create a corresponding YAML configuration file in the `zenml-projects-backend` repository. This file should include all the following attributes:

```yaml
project_id: your-project-id
name: Your Project Name
description: A comprehensive description of what your project does and its key features
github: https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml-projects/tree/main/your-project-directory
preview_image: https://github.com/your-org/your-project/raw/main/assets/preview.png
main_image_link: https://public-flavor-logos.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/projects/[PROJECT_NUMBER].jpg

## üñºÔ∏è Image Requirements

### Main Project Image

The `main_image_link` should point to an image stored in the S3 bucket:
```
https://public-flavor-logos.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/projects/[PROJECT_NUMBER].jpg
```

**Image Requirements:**
- Format: JPG or PNG
- Recommended size: 1200x630 pixels
- High quality and representative of your project
- Upload to the S3 bucket before adding to YAML

### Preview Image

The `preview_image` can be:
- Stored in your project's assets directory
- Hosted on GitHub (using raw.githubusercontent.com URLs)
- External hosting (ensure it's reliable)

## üöÄ Deployment Process

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Add Project to This Repository**
   - Create your project directory
   - Include `requirements.txt`
   - Add `Dockerfile` if needed
   - Include comprehensive README.md
   - Test your project locally

2. **Upload Main Image to S3**
   - Upload your main project image to the S3 bucket
   - Note the project number for the YAML file

3. **Create Backend Configuration**
   - Fork the `zenml-projects-backend` repository
   - Create the YAML configuration file
   - Submit a pull request

4. **Automatic Sync**
   - Once both PRs are merged to main
   - GitHub Actions will automatically sync the project list with Webflow
   - Your project will appear on the ZenML Projects website

### Testing Your Setup

Before submitting your PR, ensure:
- [ ] Your project runs locally with ZenML
- [ ] All dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`
- [ ] Dockerfile builds successfully (if included)
- [ ] README.md is comprehensive and clear
- [ ] All required YAML attributes are filled out
- [ ] Images are accessible and high quality
