**Development Environment:**
- **Source Code Repository:** https://github.com/zenml-io/credit-scoring-ai-act.git
- **Version Control System:** Git
- **CI/CD Platform:** ZenML Pipelines

### 2(b) Design Specifications

| **Specification** | **Details** |
|-------------------|-------------|
| **Model Architecture** | Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (XGBoost) |
| **Optimization Objective** | Maximize balanced accuracy while minimizing fairness disparities across protected groups |

**Design Rationale and Assumptions:**

We assume complete financial history, stable macroeconomy.


**Compliance Trade-offs:**

We reduced model complexity to improve explainability, which slightly reduced accuracy but significantly improved transparency in decision-making as required by the EU AI Act.


### 2(c) System Architecture


![System Architecture](../../../assets/e2e.png)
*Figure 3: Detailed System Architecture*


**Computational Resources:**

Training requires 8 vCPU, 32 GB RAM, and GPU acceleration. Inference runs on standard 2 vCPU, 8 GB RAM instances.


### 2(d) Data Requirements and Provenance


**Dataset Overview:**
- **Name:** Credit Scoring Dataset
- **Source:** Historical loan application data (5-year span)
- **Size:** ~10,000 records
- **Features:** Age, income, employment, credit history, debt, payment history
- **Target:** Binary credit risk classification


**Data Processing Methodology:**

Data is selected from a balanced historical loan dataset spanning 5 years. Sensitive attributes are removed or anonymized during preprocessing. Labels are derived from actual loan outcomes with a 24-month performance window.


### 2(e) Human Oversight Assessment


Human oversight is implemented through a mandatory approval workflow before any model deployment. The system flags potentially biased predictions for human review.


### 2(f) Predetermined Changes and Continuous Compliance


The system continuously monitors fairness metrics and performance. Automated retraining is triggered if drift is detected, with a quarterly schedule for full compliance reassessment.


### 2(g) Validation and Testing Procedures

**Performance Metrics:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Accuracy | 0.87 |
| Precision | 0.82 |
| Recall | 0.79 |
| F1_score | 0.8 |
| Auc | 0.89 |
| Fairness_score | 0.92 |


**Fairness Assessment:**

| Fairness Metric | Score |
|-----------------|-------|
| Demographic Parity | 0.92 |
| Equal Opportunity | 0.89 |
| Equalized Odds | 0.85 |
| Disparate Impact Age | 0.95 |
| Disparate Impact Gender | 0.97 |


**Bias Mitigation Measures:**

We implemented post-processing techniques to minimize gender and age bias. Protected attributes are excluded from the model's training data, and we apply fairness constraints during prediction.


### 2(h) Cybersecurity Measures


The model and data are secured using access controls, encryption at rest and in transit, regular security scanning, and vulnerability assessment of the deployment infrastructure.

## 3. Monitoring, Functioning and Control

**System Capabilities and Limitations:**


- **Expected Accuracy:** 87.0%


**System Limitations:**

The system may have lower accuracy for applicants with limited credit history. It should not be used as the sole determining factor for loan approvals.


**Foreseeable Unintended Outcomes:**

The system may inadvertently perpetuate historical biases present in the training data. There is also a risk of creating a feedback loop where individuals denied credit cannot build credit history.


**Input Data Specifications:**

The system requires a minimum set of applicant data including income, employment history, existing debt, payment history, and credit score. All numerical inputs should be normalized and categorical variables encoded according to the documented schema.


---

## 4. Appropriateness of Performance Metrics


We selected AUC, precision, and recall as primary metrics based on the business need to balance risk with opportunity. Fairness metrics include demographic parity and equal opportunity difference to ensure equitable outcomes across protected groups.


---

## 5. Risk Management System


The risk management system follows a structured approach in accordance with Article 9 of the EU AI Act, consisting of:

1) Risk identification through cross-functional workshops and automated analysis
2) Risk assessment using a standardized scoring matrix for likelihood and impact
3) Risk mitigation with documented controls and responsible parties
4) Ongoing monitoring with automated drift detection
5) Regular reviews on a quarterly basis

The system prioritizes risks related to data quality, model fairness, security vulnerabilities, and performance degradation.
